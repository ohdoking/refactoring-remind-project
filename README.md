# What is Refactoring?

### First step in Refactoring 

I need to build a sold set of tests for that section of code. The test are essential because even though I follow refactorings structured to avoid most of the opportunities for introducing bugs, I’m still human and still make mistakes. Thus I need solid test.

TEST is such an important part of refactoring!

### Decomposing and redistributing the statement method.

split up the long method and move the pieces to better classes.
Smaller pieces of code then to make things more manageable.
* Switch statement 

Analyze the code to figure out what to do with the local variables 
Tool
* Refactoring Browser(smalltalk)

*comment* is essential for don’t forget what I learned or fixed

### Removing temp valuable 

### making inheritance.


# Principles in Refactoring.
*Refactoring*
* (noun) a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.
*  (verb) to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior.




** Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
